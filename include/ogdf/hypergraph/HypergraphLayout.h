 * \brief Layout algorithms for hypergraph based on edge standard
 *        representations (clique / star / tree) - HypergraphLayoutES
 *        and subset standard representation - HypergraphLayoutSS.
 *
 * ... edge standard is based partly on Section 7.2 of PhD Thesis
 * by Dr. Chimani, subset standard is based on the following paper:
 *
 * Bertault, Fran√ßois and Eades, Peter.:Drawing Hypergraphs in the
 * Subset Standard (Short Demo Paper) Graph Drawing Springer Berlin /
 * Heidelberg 2001. pp.45-76. ISBN 978-3-540-41554-1
