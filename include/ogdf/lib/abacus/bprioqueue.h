//! Bounded priority queues.
/**
 * A priority queue is a data structure storing a set of elements.
 * Each element has a key which must be an ordered data type.
 * The most important operations are the insertion
 * of an element, the determination of the element having the minimal
 * key, and the deletion of the element having minimal key.
 *
 * Since the priority queue is implemented by a heap (class AbaBHeap)
 * the insertion of a new element and the deletion of the minimal
 * element require O(log n) time if n elements are
 * stored in the priority queue. The element having minimal key
 * can be determined in constant time.
 *
 * To provide an efficient implementation the priority queue is
 * bounded, i.e., the maximal number of elements is an argument
 * of the constructor. However, if required, later a reallocation
 * can be performed.
