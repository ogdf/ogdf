/*! \class CoinWarmStartBasis
    \brief The default COIN simplex (basis-oriented) warm start class
    
    CoinWarmStartBasis provides for a warm start object which contains the
    status of each variable (structural and artificial).

    \todo Modify this class so that the number of status entries per byte
	  and bytes per status vector allocation unit are not hardcoded.
	  At the least, collect this into a couple of macros.
    
    \todo Consider separate fields for allocated capacity and actual basis
	  size. We could avoid some reallocation, at the price of retaining
	  more space than we need. Perhaps more important, we could do much
	  better sanity checks.

  This class exists in order to hide from the world the details of

  objects. For convenience, assignment, cloning, and deletion are visible to
  the world, and default and copy constructors are made available to derived
  classes.  Knowledge of the rest of this structure, and of generating and
  applying diffs, is restricted to the friend functions
  CoinWarmStartBasis::generateDiff() and CoinWarmStartBasis::applyDiff().

  The actual data structure is an unsigned int vector, #difference_ which
  starts with indices of changed and then has values starting after #sze_

  \todo This is a pretty generic structure, and vector diff is a pretty generic
	activity. We should be able to convert this to a template.

  \todo Using unsigned int as the data type for the diff vectors might help
	to contain the damage when this code is inevitably compiled for 64 bit
	architectures. But the notion of int as 4 bytes is hardwired into
	CoinWarmStartBasis, so changes are definitely required.
