/*! \class CoinPresolveAction
    \brief Abstract base class of all presolve routines.

  The details will make more sense after a quick overview of the grand plan:
  A presolve object is handed a problem object, which it is expected to
  modify in some useful way.  Assuming that it succeeds, the presolve object
  should create a postsolve object, <i>i.e.</i>, an object that contains
  instructions for backing out the presolve transform to recover the original
  problem. These postsolve objects are accumulated in a linked list, with each
  successive presolve action adding its postsolve action to the head of the
  list. The end result of all this is a presolved problem object, and a list
  of postsolve objects. The presolved problem object is then handed to a
  solver for optimization, and the problem object augmented with the
  results.  The list of postsolve objects is then traversed. Each of them
  (un)modifies the problem object, with the end result being the original
  problem, augmented with solution information.

  The problem object representation is CoinPrePostsolveMatrix and subclasses.
  Check there for details. The \c CoinPresolveAction class and subclasses
  represent the presolve and postsolve objects.

  In spite of the name, the only information held in a \c CoinPresolveAction
  object is the information needed to postsolve (<i>i.e.</i>, the information
  needed to back out the presolve transformation). This information is not
  expected to change, so the fields are all \c const.

  A subclass of \c CoinPresolveAction, implementing a specific pre/postsolve
  action, is expected to declare a static function that attempts to perform a
  presolve transformation. This function will be handed a CoinPresolveMatrix
  to transform, and a pointer to the head of the list of postsolve objects.
  If the transform is successful, the function will create a new
  \c CoinPresolveAction object, link it at the head of the list of postsolve
  objects, and return a pointer to the postsolve object it has just created.
  Otherwise, it should return 0. It is expected that these static functions
  will be the only things that can create new \c CoinPresolveAction objects;
  this is expressed by making each subclass' constructor(s) private.

  Every subclass must also define a \c postsolve method.
  This function will be handed a CoinPostsolveMatrix to transform.

  It is the client's responsibility to implement presolve and postsolve driver
  routines. See OsiPresolve for examples.

  \note Since the only fields in a \c CoinPresolveAction are \c const, anything
	one can do with a variable declared \c CoinPresolveAction* can also be
	done with a variable declared \c const \c CoinPresolveAction* It is
	expected that all derived subclasses of \c CoinPresolveAction also have
	this property.

/*! \class CoinPrePostsolveMatrix
    \brief Collects all the information about the problem that is needed
	   in both presolve and postsolve.
    
    In a bit more detail, a column-major representation of the constraint
    matrix and upper and lower bounds on variables and constraints, plus row
    and column solutions, reduced costs, and status. There's also a set of
    arrays holding the original row and column numbers.

    As presolve and postsolve transform the matrix, it will occasionally be
    necessary to expand the number of entries in a column. There are two
    aspects:
    <ul>
      <li> During postsolve, the constraint system is expected to grow as
	   the smaller presolved system is transformed back to the original
	   system.
      <li> During both pre- and postsolve, transforms can increase the number
	   of coefficients in a row or column. (See the 
	   variable substitution, doubleton, and tripleton transforms.)
    </ul>

    The first is addressed by the members #ncols0_, #nrows0_, and #nelems0_.
    These should be set (via constructor parameters) to values large enough
    for the largest size taken on by the constraint system. Typically, this
    will be the size of the original constraint system.

    The second is addressed by a generous allocation of extra (empty) space
    for the arrays used to hold coefficients and row indices. When columns
    must be expanded, they are moved into the empty space. When it is used up,
    the arrays are compacted. When compaction fails to produce sufficient
    space, presolve/postsolve will fail.

    CoinPrePostsolveMatrix isn't really intended to be used `bare' --- the
    expectation is that it'll be used through CoinPresolveMatrix or
    CoinPostsolveMatrix. Some of the functions needed to load a problem are
    defined in the derived classes.

  When CoinPresolve is applied when reoptimising, we need to be prepared to
  accept a basis and modify it in step with the presolve actions (otherwise
  we throw away all the advantages of warm start for reoptimization). But
  other solution components (#acts_, #rowduals_, #sol_, and #rcosts_) are
  needed only for postsolve, where they're used in places to determine the
  proper action(s) when restoring rows or columns.  If presolve is provided
  with a solution, it will modify it in step with the presolve actions.
  Moving the solution components from CoinPrePostsolveMatrix to
  CoinPostsolveMatrix would break a lot of code.  It's not clear that it's
  worth it, and it would preclude upgrades to the presolve side that might
  make use of any of these.  -- lh, 080501 --

    \brief Links to aid in packed matrix modification

   Currently, the matrices held by the CoinPrePostsolveMatrix and
   CoinPresolveMatrix objects are represented in the same way as a
   CoinPackedMatrix. In the course of presolve and postsolve transforms, it
   will happen that a major-dimension vector needs to increase in size. In
   order to check whether there is enough room to add another coefficient in
   place, it helps to know the next vector (in memory order) in the bulk
   storage area. To do that, a linked list of major-dimension vectors is
   maintained; the "pre" and "suc" fields give the previous and next vector,
   in memory order (that is, the vector whose mcstrt_ or mrstrt_ entry is
   next smaller or larger).

   Consider a column-major matrix with ncols columns. By definition,
   presolvehlink[ncols].pre points to the column in the last occupied

/*! \class CoinPostsolveMatrix
    \brief Augments CoinPrePostsolveMatrix with information about the problem
	   that is only needed during postsolve.

  The notable point is that the matrix representation is threaded. The
  representation is column-major and starts with the standard two pairs of
  arrays: one pair to hold the row indices and coefficients, the second pair
  to hold the column starting positions and lengths. But the row indices and
  coefficients for a column do not necessarily occupy a contiguous block in
  their respective arrays. Instead, a link array gives the position of the
  next (row index,coefficient) pair. If the row index and value of a
  coefficient a<p,j> occupy position kp in their arrays, then the position of
  the next coefficient a<q,j> is found as kq = link[kp].

  This threaded representation allows for efficient expansion of columns as
  rows are reintroduced during postsolve transformations. The basic packed
  structures are allocated to the expected size of the postsolved matrix,
  and as new coefficients are added, their location is simply added to the
  thread for the column.

  There is no provision to convert the threaded representation to a packed
  representation. In the context of postsolve, it's not required. (You did
  keep a copy of the original matrix, eh?)
