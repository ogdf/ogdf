    \brief A `diff' between two CoinWarmStartDual objects

  This class exists in order to hide from the world the details of
  calculating and representing a `diff' between two CoinWarmStartDual
  objects. For convenience, assignment, cloning, and deletion are visible to
  the world, and default and copy constructors are made available to derived
  classes.  Knowledge of the rest of this structure, and of generating and
  applying diffs, is restricted to the friend functions
  CoinWarmStartDual::generateDiff() and CoinWarmStartDual::applyDiff().

  The actual data structure is a pair of vectors, #diffNdxs_ and #diffVals_.
