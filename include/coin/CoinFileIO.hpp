   The file name is constructed from \p name using the following rules:
   <ul>
     <li> An absolute path is not modified.
     <li> If the name begins with `~', an attempt is made to replace `~'
	  with the value of the environment variable HOME.
     <li> If a default prefix (\p dfltPrefix) is provided, it is
	  prepended to the name.
   </ul>
   If the constructed file name cannot be opened, and CoinUtils was built
   with support for compressed files, fileCoinReadable will try any
   standard extensions for supported compressed files.

   The value returned in \p name is the file name that actually worked.
