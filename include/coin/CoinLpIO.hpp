Notes: <UL>
 <LI> Keywords are: Min, Max, Minimize, Maximize, s.t., Subject To, 
      Bounds, Integers, Generals, Binaries, End, Free, Inf. 
 <LI> Keywords are not case sensitive and may be in plural or singular form.
      They should not be used as objective, row or column names.
 <LI> Bounds, Integers, Generals, Binaries sections are optional.
 <LI> Generals and Integers are synonymous.
 <LI> Bounds section (if any) must come before Integers, Generals, and 
      Binaries sections.
 <LI> Row names must be followed by ':' without blank space.
      Row names are optional. If row names are present, 
      they must be distinct (if the k-th constraint has no given name, its name
      is set automatically to "consk" for k=0,...,).
      For valid row names, see the method is_invalid_name(). 
 <LI> Column names must be followed by a blank space. They must be distinct. 
      For valid column names, see the method is_invalid_name(). 
 <LI> The objective function name must be followed by ':' without blank space.
      Objective function name is optional (if no objective function name
      is given, it is set to "obj" by default).
      For valid objective function names, see the method is_invalid_name(). 
 <LI> Ranged constraints are written as two constraints.
      If a name is given for a ranged constraint, the upper bound constraint 
      has that name and the lower bound constraint has that name with "_low" 
      as suffix. This should be kept in mind when assigning names to ranged
      constraint, as the resulting name must be distinct from all the other
      names and be considered valid by the method is_invalid_name().
 <LI> At most one constant term may appear in the objective function; 
      if present, it must appear last. 
 <LI> Default bounds are 0 for lower bound and +infinity for upper bound.
 <LI> Free variables get default lower bound -infinity and 
      default upper bound +infinity. Writing "x0 Free" in an
      LP file means "set lower bound on x0 to -infinity".
 <LI> If more than one upper (resp. lower) bound on a variable appears in 
      the Bounds section, the last one is the one taken into 
      account. The bounds for a binary variable are set to 0/1 only if this 
      bound is stronger than the bound obtained from the Bounds section. 
 <LI> Numbers larger than DBL_MAX (or larger than 1e+400) in the input file
      might crash the code.
 <LI> A comment must start with '\' or '/'. That symbol must either be
      the first character of a line or be preceded by a blank space. The 
      comment ends at the end of the 
      line. Comments are skipped while reading an Lp file and they may be
      inserted anywhere.
