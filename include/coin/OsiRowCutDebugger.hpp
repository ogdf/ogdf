/*! \brief Validate cuts against a known solution

  OsiRowCutDebugger provides a facility for validating cuts against a known
  solution for a problem. The debugger knows an optimal solution for many of
  the miplib3 problems. Check the source for
  #activate(const OsiSolverInterface&,const char*)
  in OsiRowCutDebugger.cpp for the full set of known problems.

  A full solution vector can be supplied as a parameter with
  (#activate(const OsiSolverInterface&,const double*,bool)).
  Only the integer values need to be valid.
  The default behaviour is to solve an lp relaxation with the integer
  variables fixed to the specified values and use the optimal solution to fill
  in the continuous variables in the solution.
  The debugger can be instructed to preserve the continuous variables (useful
  when debugging solvers where the linear relaxation doesn't capture all the
  constraints).

  Note that the solution must match the problem held in the solver interface.
  If you want to use the row cut debugger on a problem after applying presolve
  transformations, your solution must match the presolved problem. (But see
  #redoSolution().)
