/*! \class OsiPresolve
    \brief OSI interface to COIN problem simplification capabilities

  COIN provides a number of classes which implement problem simplification
  algorithms (CoinPresolveAction, CoinPrePostsolveMatrix, and derived
  classes). The model of operation is as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a copy of the original problem.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subject the copy to a series of transformations (the <i>presolve</i>
      methods) to produce a presolved model. Each transformation is also
      expected to provide a method to reverse the transformation (the
      <i>postsolve</i> method). The postsolve methods are collected in a
      linked list; the postsolve method for the final presolve transformation
      is at the head of the list.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hand the presolved problem to the solver for optimization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apply the collected postsolve methods to the presolved problem
      and solution, restating the solution in terms of the original problem.
    </li>
  </ul>

  The COIN presolve algorithms are unaware of OSI. The OsiPresolve class takes
  care of the interface. Given an OsiSolverInterface \c origModel, it will take
  care of creating a clone properly loaded with the presolved problem and ready
  for optimization. After optimization, it will apply postsolve
  transformations and load the result back into \c origModel.
  
  Assuming a problem has been loaded into an
  \c OsiSolverInterface \c origModel, a bare-bones application looks like this:
  \code
  OsiPresolve pinfo ;
  OsiSolverInterface *presolvedModel ;
  // Return an OsiSolverInterface loaded with the presolved problem.
  presolvedModel = pinfo.presolvedModel(*origModel,1.0e-8,false,numberPasses) ;
  presolvedModel->initialSolve() ;
  // Restate the solution and load it back into origModel.
  pinfo.postsolve(true) ;
  delete presolvedModel ;
  \endcode
*/

  /*! \brief Create a new OsiSolverInterface loaded with the presolved problem.

    This method implements the first two steps described in the class
    documentation.  It clones \c origModel and applies presolve
    transformations, storing the resulting list of postsolve
    transformations.  It returns a pointer to a new OsiSolverInterface loaded
    with the presolved problem, or NULL if the problem is infeasible or
    unbounded.  If \c keepIntegers is true then bounds may be tightened in
    the original. Bounds will be moved by up to \c feasibilityTolerance to
    try and stay feasible. When \c doStatus is true, the current solution will
    be transformed to match the presolved model.

    This should be paired with postsolve(). It is up to the client to
    destroy the returned OsiSolverInterface, <i>after</i> calling postsolve().

    postsolve() restates the solution in terms of the original problem and
    updates the original OsiSolverInterface supplied to presolvedModel().  If
    the problem has not been solved to optimality, there are no guarantees.
    If you are using an algorithm like simplex that has a concept of a basic
    solution, then set updateStatus

    The advantage of going back to the original problem is that it
    will be exactly as it was, <i>i.e.</i>, 0.0 will not become 1.0e-19.

    Note that if you modified the original problem after presolving, then you
    must ``undo'' these modifications before calling postsolve().

    In some sense, a wrapper for postsolve(CoinPostsolveMatrix&).
