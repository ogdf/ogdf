  Physical removal of rows and columns should be the last activities
  performed during presolve. Do them exactly once. The row-major matrix
  is <b>not</b> maintained by this transform.

  To physically drop the columns, CoinPrePostsolveMatrix::mcstrt_ and
  CoinPrePostsolveMatrix::hincol_ are compressed, along with column bounds,
  objective, and (if present) the column portions of the solution. This
  renumbers the columns. drop_empty_cols_action::presolve will reconstruct
  CoinPresolveMatrix::clink_.

  \todo Confirm correct behaviour with solution in presolve.
