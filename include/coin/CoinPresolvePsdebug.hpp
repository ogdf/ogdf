/*! \defgroup PresolveDebugFunctions Presolve Debug Functions

  These functions implement consistency checks on data structures
  involved in presolve and postsolve and on the components of the lp solution.

  To use these functions, include CoinPresolvePsdebug.hpp in your file and
  define the compile-time constants PRESOLVE_SUMMARY, PRESOLVE_DEBUG, and
  PRESOLVE_CONSISTENCY (either in individual files or in Coin/Makefile).
  A value is needed (<i>i.e.</i>, PRESOLVE_DEBUG=1) but not at present used
  to control debug level. Be sure that the definition occurs before any
  CoinPresolve*.hpp file is processed.
